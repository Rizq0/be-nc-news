Instructions to create environment variables to connect to the correct database:

This project uses dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) which allows the storage of environment variables in seperate files.

At the root of the project, please create two seperate files starting with .env and include the text underneath (PGDATABASE) within that file:

.env.test
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

.env.development
PGDATABASE=nc_news
